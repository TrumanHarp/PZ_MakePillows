description=Glad you asked!
description=
description=To get started you must make a bunch of Pillow Fluff.
description=You can further rip up ripped sheets to get pillow fluff. Then you need to combine a lot of pillow fluff with a sheet and some thread using a needle to get yourself a wonderful new pillow.
description=Note: You will need a tailoring skill of 1 to be able to make pillows.

description=You can also now rip apart pillows, resulting in a sheet and a litle pillow fluff back.
description=Both making and ripping pillows will give you a little bit of tailoring xp.
